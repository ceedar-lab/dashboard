# Dashboard \<CDEV CAMP\/>

A dashbord realised during IPI CDev Camp which is not finished yet. Actually only 4 widgets are functional. Other will come soon !

Here is the home screen :

## Configuration

You can display from 1 to 20 widgets on the screen and display up to 5 widgets on a row.

There are 3 different th√®me : a **default** white and grey, a dark blue **midnight** theme and a dark red **inferno** theme.

Have a look :

**Midnight Theme**|**Inferno Theme**


## Widgets

As I said in my introduction, only 4 widgets are functional (or nearly) :

* **Calculator :** Very basic, you can add, subtract, multiply and divide. It will get better with time.
* **Meteo :** Use [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API. You will need your own free key to use it. Add it into the **default.js** file (openweathermap_key:7)
* **Stopwatch :** A pretty cool old style stopwatch. Three buttons, who need more ?
* **Radio :** If you like latin music, press play and listen to french station [Radio Latina](https://www.latina.fr/). Else, feel free to change the radio_url array in the **default.js**. 

And now the screenshots :

That's all for now. I'm working on other widgets and a local storage functionality
